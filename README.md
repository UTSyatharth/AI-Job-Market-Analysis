# ðŸ§  AI/ML Job Market Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview
This project analyzes trends, salaries, skills, and hiring patterns in the AI/ML job market. It provides insights on job demand, top locations, experience levels, salary distributions, in-demand skills, and trends over time. Additionally, it demonstrates simple machine learning modeling to predict salaries based on job title and experience level.
